### Modeling
Baseline Model
A simple baseline model was created using a basic classifier to establish a benchmark for model performance.

Decision Tree Model
A Decision Tree Classifier was implemented to understand the importance of different features in predicting the waterpoint status.

Gradient Boosting Model
A more sophisticated Gradient Boosting Classifier was implemented to improve prediction accuracy.

Hyperparameter Tuning
GridSearchCV was used for hyperparameter tuning to find the best parameters for the Gradient Boosting Model, improving its performance.
Analysis

** Primary factors affecting functionality:

Features like gps_height, amount_tsh, and construction_year play significant roles.
Geographical features (region, basin) and demographic variables (population) also influence functionality.

** Role of geographical and demographic variables:

The functionality of waterpoints varies significantly across different regions and basins.
Waterpoints in more populated areas tend to have different functionality rates.

** Correlation with construction year:

Older waterpoints are more likely to be non-functional or need repair.

** Funders and installers:

Certain funders and installers are associated with higher functionality rates, indicating the quality of installation and maintenance practices.

** Water quality relationship:

Waterpoints with poor water quality tend to have lower functionality rates.

## Future Work
#### Conclusions for future works
Logistic Regression: While it is simple and interpretable, logistic regression falls short in performance due to its inability to capture non-linear relationships.

Decision Tree: Offers better performance than logistic regression by capturing non-linear patterns but suffers from overfitting, particularly with deeper trees.

Gradient Boosting: Provides the best performance, effectively capturing complex patterns in the data. It requires careful tuning to prevent overfitting and to achieve optimal performance.

#### Recommendations for future works
Model Selection: Based on performance, gradient boosting is recommended for predicting the operational status of waterpoints due to its superior accuracy and ability to handle complex relationships.

Interpretability: For stakeholders requiring interpretability, a decision tree can be used to provide insights into the decision-making process. However, this should be complemented with gradient boosting for actual predictions.

Feature Importance: Utilize the feature importance scores from decision trees or gradient boosting to understand key factors affecting waterpoint functionality.

Further Tuning: Continue tuning gradient boosting parameters (e.g., learning rate, number of trees, max depth) to further enhance performance. Techniques like cross-validation and early stopping should be used to avoid overfitting.

Model Deployment: Implement gradient boosting in the production environment for real-time predictions, ensuring continuous monitoring and retraining as new data becomes available.

Stakeholder Communication: Use visualizations and simplified decision tree representations to communicate findings to non-technical stakeholders, emphasizing the key factors affecting waterpoint functionality.

By adopting these recommendations, the organization can effectively leverage machine learning to predict waterpoint status, thereby improving maintenance planning and resource allocation for water infrastructure projects.


### CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE NGO
##### Conclusion
The analysis and model evaluation of waterpoint functionality have provided valuable insights into the factors affecting the operational status of waterpoints. 

The key findings are:

Primary Factors: Important factors influencing the functionality of waterpoints include geographical location (region, basin), population, GPS height, construction year, and funders/installers.

Model Performance: Gradient boosting emerged as the best-performing model with an accuracy of 76.14%, significantly outperforming logistic regression and decision tree models.

Geographical and Demographic Influence: Regions and basins significantly impact waterpoint functionality, with certain areas showing higher rates of non-functional waterpoints. Population and GPS height also correlate with operational status.

Waterpoint Age: Older waterpoints tend to be less functional, indicating a need for timely maintenance and rehabilitation.

Funding and Installation: Certain funders and installers are associated with higher functionality rates, highlighting the importance of quality workmanship and investment.

##### Recommendations
Based on the findings, the following recommendations are made for improving the functionality and maintenance of waterpoints:

Targeted Maintenance and Rehabilitation:

Focus maintenance efforts on older waterpoints, especially those constructed before 2000, as they show higher rates of non-functionality.

Prioritize regions and basins with higher non-functional rates for targeted interventions.

Geographical Strategy:

Implement region-specific strategies to address unique geographical challenges. For example, waterpoints in high-altitude areas (higher GPS height) may require different maintenance approaches compared to those in lower-altitude regions
Collaborate with local authorities and communities to understand and address region-specific issues affecting waterpoint functionality.

Funding and Installation Quality:

Encourage the involvement of funders and installers with proven track records of high functionality rates. Establish partnerships and offer incentives to attract quality workmanship.

Implement standardized installation protocols and provide training for installers to ensure consistency and reliability.

Continuous Monitoring and Data Collection:

Establish a system for continuous monitoring of waterpoints to quickly identify and address issues. Utilize IoT devices for real-time data collection where feasible.

Regularly update the waterpoint database with new information on functionality, repairs, and upgrades to improve predictive accuracy and maintenance planning.

Community Engagement and Training:

Engage with local communities to foster ownership and responsibility for waterpoint maintenance. Provide training on basic maintenance and troubleshooting.

Implement community reporting mechanisms to quickly identify non-functional waterpoints and facilitate timely repairs.

Water Quality Management:

Investigate the relationship between water quality and functionality further. Address any water quality issues that may contribute to non-functionality, such as contamination or mineral buildup.

Promote regular water quality testing and implement treatment solutions where necessary to ensure safe and reliable water supply.

Policy and Investment:

Advocate for policies that support sustainable waterpoint management, including adequate funding for maintenance and rehabilitation.

Secure long-term investment to ensure continuous improvement and expansion of waterpoint infrastructure, particularly in underserved regions.

By implementing these recommendations, stakeholders can significantly improve the functionality and reliability of waterpoints, ensuring a sustainable water supply for communities.

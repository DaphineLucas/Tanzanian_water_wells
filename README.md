## Waterpoint Status Classification
Project Overview
This project aims to predict the operational status of waterpoints in Tanzania. The dataset includes various features such as geographical information, demographic data, waterpoint characteristics, and more. The primary goal is to classify each waterpoint as either functional, functional needs repair, or non functional.

amount_tsh: Total static head (amount water available to waterpoint).
date_recorded: The date the row was entered.
funder: Who funded the well.
gps_height: Altitude of the well.
installer: Organization that installed the well.
longitude: GPS coordinate.
latitude: GPS coordinate.
num_private: Unknown.
basin: Geographic water basin.
region: Geographic region.
region_code: Region code.
district_code: District code.
lga: Local Government Area.
ward: Ward.
population: Population around the well.
recorded_by: Group entering this row of data.
scheme_management: Who operates the waterpoint.
scheme_name: The name of the scheme.
permit: If the waterpoint is permitted.
construction_year: Year the waterpoint was constructed.
extraction_type: The kind of extraction the waterpoint uses.
management: How the waterpoint is managed.
payment: Payment type for water.
payment_type: Payment type.
water_quality: The quality of the water.
quantity: The quantity of water.
source: The source of the water.
source_class: Categorical variable for source.
waterpoint_type: The kind of waterpoint.
status_group: The operational status of the waterpoint.
### Modeling
Baseline Model
A simple baseline model was created using a basic classifier to establish a benchmark for model performance.

Decision Tree Model
A Decision Tree Classifier was implemented to understand the importance of different features in predicting the waterpoint status.

Gradient Boosting Model
A more sophisticated Gradient Boosting Classifier was implemented to improve prediction accuracy.

Hyperparameter Tuning
GridSearchCV was used for hyperparameter tuning to find the best parameters for the Gradient Boosting Model, improving its performance.
Analysis

** Primary factors affecting functionality:

Features like gps_height, amount_tsh, and construction_year play significant roles.
Geographical features (region, basin) and demographic variables (population) also influence functionality.

** Role of geographical and demographic variables:

The functionality of waterpoints varies significantly across different regions and basins.
Waterpoints in more populated areas tend to have different functionality rates.

** Correlation with construction year:

Older waterpoints are more likely to be non-functional or need repair.

** Funders and installers:

Certain funders and installers are associated with higher functionality rates, indicating the quality of installation and maintenance practices.

** Water quality relationship:

Waterpoints with poor water quality tend to have lower functionality rates.

## Future Work
Further refine the models with advanced techniques such as ensemble learning.

Incorporate additional features and external data sources to improve predictions.

Develop a web application for real-time prediction and visualization of waterpoint functionality.
